# Microsoft Defender Compliance Essentials to Secure Azure Cloud Services

## Objective

The Microsoft Defender with Azure project is a coursera-led project by Microsoft to teach about using Azure Services. I will be learning how to consolidate processes into a central hub, accelerate tasks, and reduce oversight risk. By the end of the project I will better understand Microsoft Defender, Log Queries, and Key Vaults within Azure to securely operate a cloud network.

### Skills Learned

- Configuring Log Analytics workspaces for Microsoft Defender in the cloud.
- Manufacturing an environment for Microsoft Defender to protect against threats in the cloud.
- Putting together a log agent for effective centralization.
- Implementing secure Azure Key Vaults.

### Tools Used

- Microsoft Azure to set up Microsoft Defender, Key Vaults, & Log Analytic Workspaces.
- Azure Key Vaults to create or add Keys, Secret Codes, & Certificates.

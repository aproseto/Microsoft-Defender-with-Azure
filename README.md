# Microsoft Defender Compliance Essentials to Secure Azure Cloud Services

## Objective

The Microsoft Defender with Azure project is a coursera-led project by Microsoft to teach about using Azure Services. I will be learning how to consolidate processes into a central hub, accelerate tasks, and reduce oversight risk. By the end of the project I will better understand processes within Azure to securely operate a cloud network.

### Skills Learned

- Configuring Log Analytics workspaces for Microsoft Defender in the cloud.
- Manufacturing an environment for Microsoft Defender to protect against threats in the cloud.
- Putting together a log agent for effective centralization.
- Implementing secure Azure Key Vaults.

### Tools Used
[Bullet Points - Remove this afterwards]

- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for log ingestion and analysis.
- Network analysis tools (such as Wireshark) for capturing and examining network traffic.
- Telemetry generation tools to create realistic network traffic and attack scenarios.
